"""Asks (docs/factory.md section 3): the Assistant asks the person without blocking its own pane.

`herdr-task ask "<question>" --option A --option B --recommend A` keeps the ask in the store
(asks/<id>.json) and starts its ask pane: a tiny hc terminal that prints the question as a
numbered prompt and reports itself blocked on a question over OSC 7501, as agents report to
herdr-core, so whatever watches terminals (sheepdog, hc get) sees a question waiting. The answer
(an option's number, or words of one's own) goes into the record, the pane exits, and the answer
reaches the asker as news: sent at once, or held for the scheduler while it can't take it (the
person is writing to it, hc refused). `ask --show <id>` reads a record: held news goes when its
Assistant has ended, so a restarted one can still find the answer.
